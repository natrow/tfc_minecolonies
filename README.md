# TFC Minecolonies Compatibility Addon

![](img/banner.png)

This mod attempts to provide seemless compatibility between TerraFirmaCraft and Minecolonies.
It heavily modifies internal Minecolonies code, expanding on its features and adding support for
aspects of TFC's gameplay that doesn't exist in Vanilla.

Currently, the mod will focus on standard TFC. Future support for other addons may be created in
the future.
